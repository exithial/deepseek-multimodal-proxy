## [Unreleased]

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Dashboard: global range selector + arbitrary historical range endpoint** (PR #13). The dashboard now has a single `24h / 7d / 30d / 90d / total` selector at the top of the page that drives the hero cards, the chart, and the per-model table. The previous dual `cardRange` / `chartRange` setup is gone — one range, one source of truth, snapshot polls do not clobber a custom range view.
  - `GET /v1/dashboard/range?from=<iso>&to=<iso>` (new endpoint) returns totals + an auto-bucketed series (hourly for spans ≤48h, daily otherwise). Capped at `DASHBOARD_RETENTION_DAYS`; returns `400` with structured bodies for `missing_params`, `invalid_timestamp`, `invalid_range`, and `range_exceeds_retention` (the last one includes `maxMs` in the body).
  - `dashboardService.getRange(fromTs, toTs)` and the refactor of `totalsRow` → `totalsInRange(fromTs, toTs)` + `hourlyBucketsInRange` + `breakdownInRange` (half-open `[from, to)` bounds). `windowsRow()` returns `Record<WindowKey, WindowBreakdown>` (totals + filtered `byModel` + `byBrain` per window) so every preset window is pre-aggregated server-side.
  - `fmtCompact(value, { currency? })` helper for large-number display (`48,8 M`, `12,3 K`, `1,23 B`) so totals never overflow the hero card on any locale.
  - `CUSTOM` range expand with inline `DESDE / HASTA / APPLY` panel. Hero tag becomes `Σ <range>` (e.g. `Σ 24H`, `Σ rango` for custom).
  - 12 new unit tests: `fmtCompact` (8 cases), `windowsRow` windowed totals + `byModel` filtering (2), `getRange` hourly/daily auto-bucket + half-open bounds (5), route validation (6). Total: 265/265 passing.
  - 1 new dev dep: `supertest@^7` (dev only) for the route tests.
- **Dashboard responsive layout for narrow viewports** (PR #12). Hero cards no longer overflow on Fold6 cover / ≤600px screens. New `public/dashboard/mobile.js` (121 lines) dedicated to responsive logic, kept separate from `app.js`. 47 new unit tests in `tests/unit/dashboard/mobile.test.ts`.

### Fixed

- **Direct DeepSeek payload: `reasoning_effort: "max"` restored on Pro and Flash** (PR #14). The v3.2.0 pluggable-provider refactor had silently dropped the v2.0.0 default; `deepseekBrainProvider` was only sending `thinking: { type: "enabled" }`, causing DeepSeek upstream to fall back to `reasoning_effort: "high"` instead of `max`. DeepSeek officially recommends `max` for agent scenarios; Flash 0731 was re-trained at `max` effort. Fix: when `thinking` is enabled, also set `payload.reasoning_effort = "max"`. OpenCode Go brains (which proxy the same models through the OpenCode Go flavor) are unaffected — they inherit the upstream default. Test covers both `deepseek-v4-pro` and `deepseek-v4-flash`.
- **Dashboard: `.cards-range` styles restored** (lost during merge resolution of #13). Without them the range selector buttons rendered as raw text adjacent to the hero cards with no visible separation. Re-added 40 lines of CSS: 40px margin-bottom on the wrapper, segregated control visuals, full-width on ≤600px so buttons wrap cleanly on narrow viewports.
- **Dashboard: hero tag and chart title now reflect the active range** instead of lifetime totals. Lifetime cards were growing into the tens of millions and visually overflowing; there was no indication of what window the totals covered and no way to reset.

### Changed

- **Documentation: `proxy/deepseek-v4-flash` now visible everywhere it was already running**. The model was already registered at runtime in `providerSelector.ts` for `BRAIN_MODE=deepseek` and `hybrid`, but the user-facing docs (Brain Models table, Pricing table, OpenCode Integration examples, Models section) did not list it. README.md, MODELS.md, and CLAUDE.md updated to reflect the actual behavior. Pricing: $0.435 / $0.87 per 1M (post-June 2026 cut; previous $1.74 / $3.48 was pre-cut).
- **CLAUDE.md: brain context window policy** notes the restored `reasoning_effort: max` on direct DeepSeek — explicit line added under "All brains use max thinking".
- **CHANGELOG.md: bullet density** (this entry follows the prior [3.3.0] and [3.2.0] entries' `### Added / ### Changed / ### Fixed` structure; the previous single-bullet `[Unreleased]` block was rewritten to be scannable).

## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Informational dashboard** (PR #11) served on the same Express app and port as the proxy. No separate process, no extra auth (consistent with the rest of the proxy). Captures every request's usage, cost, latency, status, cache hit, and routing strategy, persists them to SQLite, and surfaces them in a single-page vanilla JS UI.
  - `GET /dashboard/` — UI: six hero cards (tokens in/out, cost USD, requests + error split, cache hit ratio + hits/misses, error rate, uptime), 24h/30d toggleable chart (chart.js from cdn.jsdelivr.net with SRI), models table sorted by request count, log tail with level filter (`info+` / `warn+` / `error` / `debug`) and substring search, version/BRAIN_MODE/provider footer.
  - `GET /v1/dashboard/snapshot` — JSON snapshot of operational info, totals, time-series (24h hourly + 30d daily zero-filled), per-model and per-brain breakdowns (with latency p50/p95/avg), last 200 lines of `combined.log` + `error.log` (server-side redacted), and `cacheService` stats. Returns 503 when `DASHBOARD_ENABLED=false` so the UI can show a friendly disabled banner.
  - `dashboardService` (`src/services/dashboardService.ts`): SQLite via `better-sqlite3@^12.11.1` with WAL mode, prepared statements, schema with CHECK constraints (`status`, `cache_hit`, `client`, `strategy`, non-negative token counts), indexes on `(ts, model, brain)`, hourly retention sweep (clamped `[1, 3650]` days), corruption recovery (rename bad file to `dashboard.db.broken-<ts>` and start fresh), and an `unref`'d timer that never blocks shutdown. 14 unit tests covering insert / query / retention sweep / empty DB / corruption recovery / zero-fill buckets / breakdown sorting / latency percentiles / clamp.
  - `tryRecord` wrapper in `src/index.ts`: every dashboard INSERT is deferred via `setImmediate` so the synchronous `better-sqlite3` write never sits on the request hot path. Worst case is one event-loop tick (~ms) for the write to land after `res.json` / `res.end` has flushed.
  - Static UI assets in `public/dashboard/` (no build pipeline, vanilla HTML + ES modules): `index.html` (SRI on chart.js, dotfiles-safe static handler), `app.js` (defensive escape, `fmtFinite` against NaN/Infinity, AbortController with `FIRST_POLL_TIMEOUT_MS=4000` + `pollIntervalMs * 4`, `visibilitychange` + `pagehide` to pause / clean up polling, log-tail `wasAtBottom` auto-scroll, USD formatted in en-US locale, log-level strict switch that doesn't match unknown compounds, fails-loud `els` invariant at boot), `styles.css` (dark editorial theme, Instrument Serif + JetBrains Mono), `favicon.svg` (matching the dashboard's ink + amber accent).
  - **Server-side log redaction** in `dashboardService.readRecentLogs()`: strips Bearer tokens, `sk-...` API keys, email addresses, `data:image/...;base64,<data>` URIs, and long base64 blobs before they reach the unauthenticated snapshot endpoint. Pattern order matters — `data:image` URI regex runs first so the URI is matched whole.
  - **Upstream prompt cache detection**: `minimaxM3Provider` now extracts Anthropic's `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` from the usage block and surfaces them as OpenAI's `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` (non-streaming + streaming `message_delta`). The dashboard's `cache_hits` counter now covers both Anthropic in-memory dedupe AND MiniMax prompt cache. `extractUsageFromChunk` parses both formats.
  - **Streaming chunk id fix** (MiniMax-M3): every chunk in a stream now shares the same `chatcmpl-<uuid>` id and `created` timestamp instead of generating a new id per chunk. OpenCode uses the chunk id to associate chunks with the same response and accumulate context token counts — the per-chunk-id bug was resetting OpenCode's context counter to zero on every response. Same fix applied to the streaming `usage` chunk so the dashboard capture also covers the cache field.

### Changed

- **Per-passthrough cost pricing**: `resolveBrainServiceEntry` now reads `MINIMAX_INPUT_PRICE` / `MINIMAX_OUTPUT_PRICE` env vars (USD per 1M tokens) for the `MiniMax-M3` passthrough. `mimo-v2.5` stays `0` (subscription-based via OpenCode Go). Default `0` for backward compat — the operator sees `$0` in the cost column until they set the env vars. A startup warning fires when `MINIMAX_API_KEY` is set but both prices are `0`.
- **`processMultimodalContent`** (`src/middleware/multimodalProcessor.ts`) returns `descriptionsCacheHits: number` in addition to the existing fields — always `0` today because the vision providers don't yet wire `cacheService.get()`, but the field is forward-compatible for when descriptions cache lands.
- **Docker**: `compose.yml` adds `proxy-data:/app/data` named volume (the `data/.gitkeep` placeholder lives in the repo so the volume mount point exists). `Dockerfile` now copies `public/` to `/app/public` and creates `/app/data` at build time so the container can start writing on first run.
- **`MINIMAX_TIMEOUT_MS=300000`** (5 min) replaces the silent axios 0-timeout fallback for `MiniMax-M3` calls. Long thinking runs on large contexts were timing out at the previous implicit `0`.

### Security

- **Trusted-network warning** added to both `README.md` and `.env.example` for the `/dashboard/*` and `/v1/dashboard/snapshot` endpoints. Operators must keep the dashboard on Tailscale / VPN / `127.0.0.1`; never expose it on a public IP. The recommendation is to front it with auth (Caddy, nginx `auth_basic`, Cloudflare Tunnel with Access) if broader network access is required.
- **Defaults safe-by-default**: `DASHBOARD_ENABLED=false` in `.env.example`. The dashboard exposes token counts, USD cost, and log tails at unauthenticated endpoints; the operator must consciously opt in.
- **SRI on chart.js** in `index.html`: `integrity="sha384-..."` + `crossorigin="anonymous"`. Static assets served with `Cache-Control: no-store` so a deployed build is picked up immediately (no 1h stale JS after the browser caches the old bundle).
- **dotfiles: "deny"** on `express.static` for `/dashboard/*` so a stray `.env` / `.git` inside `public/` cannot leak via the static file route.

### Backward compatibility

- The dashboard is additive. With `DASHBOARD_ENABLED=false` (the new default), every existing route (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/models`, `/health`, `/v1/cache/stats`) behaves byte-for-byte identical to v3.2.0. `tryRecord` is a no-op when disabled, so the request hot path is unchanged for operators who don't enable the dashboard.
- The MiniMax-M3 chunk id fix is observable to OpenCode users: their context counter no longer resets to zero on every response (was a bug, not a contract). Operators using other clients see no behavior change.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Pluggable brain and vision providers via `BRAIN_MODE`** (PR #9). New env var selects between four modes:
  - `auto` (default) — picks `deepseek` if `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set, else `opencode` if `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` is set; warns and proceeds if both are set.
  - `opencode` — only the 4 OpenCode Go brains (`proxy/glm-5.2`, `proxy/deepseek-v4-pro`, `proxy/qwen3.7-max`, `proxy/mimo-v2.5-pro`) plus MiMo V2.5 vision.
  - `deepseek` — only DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash brains under their standard IDs (`proxy/deepseek-v4-{pro,flash}`) plus MiniMax M3 vision (requires `MINIMAX_API_KEY`).
  - `hybrid` — both providers active: OpenCode Go brains under `proxy/<id>`, user's DeepSeek under `proxy/local-deepseek-v4-{pro,flash}`.
- **New provider interfaces**:
  - `BrainProvider` (`src/services/brainProvider.ts`) — text-only chat completion abstraction with per-entry `providerName` discriminator for hybrid routing.
  - `VisionProvider` (`src/services/visionProvider.ts`) — multimodal content description with `supportsContentType("image" | "video")` gate.
- **New provider implementations**:
  - `OpenCodeGoBrainProvider` (renamed from `opencodeGoService`) — generic OpenCode Go caller, used in `opencode`/`hybrid`.
  - `DeepSeekBrainProvider` — direct DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash via `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions`, OpenAI-compatible, OpenCode-style retries (3 attempts, 2s/4s delays on 503/502/429).
  - `MimoSensesVisionProvider` (renamed from `mimoSensesService`) — MiMo V2.5 image description via OpenCode Go.
  - `MiniMaxM3Provider` — Anthropic-format chat + image/video vision passthrough (`https://api.minimax.io/anthropic/v1/messages`), no thinking block, single `x-api-key` auth header.
- **Runtime brain registry** in `src/services/brainRegistry.ts`: `BRAIN_MODELS_BASE` (4 OpenCode Go brains), `PASSTHROUGH_MODELS = { mimo-v2.5, MiniMax-M3 }`, runtime `registerBrainEntry()`, `parseLocalProxyModelId()` with registry validation.
- **Provider selector** in `src/services/providerSelector.ts`: `BRAIN_MODE` resolver, per-entry routing via `entry.providerName`, mode-aware model filtering, mode-aware passthrough exposure in `/v1/models`.
- **Two OpenCode TUI templates** committed (both stable):
  - `opencode.json` — OpenCode Go flavor (5 entries: 4 brains + `mimo-v2.5` passthrough).
  - `opencode.deepseek.json` — DeepSeek flavor (3 entries: 2 brains + `MiniMax-M3` passthrough).
  - `scripts/select-opencode-config.sh` is informational and never mutates state.
- **Shared converters**: `anthropicPayloadConverter.ts` (OpenAI→Anthropic payload, used by `OpenCodeGoBrainProvider` and `MiniMaxM3Provider`) and `anthropicStreamConverter.ts` (Anthropic SSE → OpenAI streaming chunks).

### Changed

- **Multimodal pipeline** (`src/middleware/multimodalProcessor.ts`) accepts a `VisionProvider` and dispatches on `supportsContentType` with Gemini fallback. `parseLocalProxyModelId` now validates the parsed upstream against the registry; unknown `proxy/local-*` IDs return null instead of leaking to provider routing.
- **DeepSeek pricing** reflects the post-June 2026 price cut: $0.435 input / $0.87 output per 1M tokens (was $1.74 / $3.48 pre-cut).
- **Docker** (`compose.yml`): default to bridge networking with explicit port mapping; host-mode option left as a single commented line for advanced setups (no public networking details leaked).
- **Env validation** moved into provider constructors; each provider singleton is `process.env.KEY ? new Provider() : null`, so `BRAIN_MODE=opencode` users no longer crash on missing `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and vice versa.
- **`.env.example`**: `SENSES_MODEL` default restored to `mimo-v2.5` so a fresh install with `BRAIN_MODE=auto` + only `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` resolves correctly to the MiMo senses provider.

### Backward compatibility

- `BRAIN_MODE=auto` with only `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` set preserves byte-for-byte the v3.1.0 public contract: same 4 brains, same passthrough (`mimo-v2.5`), same `/v1/models` listing, same Anthropic SSE → OpenAI streaming conversion.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Two new text-only brains via OpenCode Go**:
  - `proxy/qwen3.7-max` — Qwen flagship, Anthropic-format (`/v1/messages`), 1M upstream context (clients see 800K auto-compact target — see CLAUDE.md § "Brain context window policy"), 65K output, $2.50 input / $7.50 output per 1M tokens. Combined with MiMo senses: **$2.64 / $7.78** per 1M.
  - `proxy/mimo-v2.5-pro` — Xiaomi "Pro" tier, OpenAI-format (`/v1/chat/completions`), 1M upstream context (clients see 800K auto-compact target), 65K output, $1.74 input / $3.48 output per 1M tokens. Combined with MiMo senses: **$1.88 / $3.76** per 1M.
- Both new brains gain image vision automatically through the existing MiMo V2.5 senses layer (no `multimodalProcessor` change needed — vision routing is keyed off the `proxy/` prefix).
- Coexistence with the existing `mimo-v2.5` passthrough preserved (no replacement; clients choose either).
- `opencode.json` updated with the two new brains (cost, limit, modalities) so OpenCode clients see them in `/v1/models`. `limit.context` is set to **800K** for both (the client-visible auto-compact target), even though the upstream accepts 1M — see the brain context window policy.

### Changed

- **All 4 brains now configured with `context: 1_048_576` (1M) in `brainRegistry.ts`** — matching the real upstream limit. GLM-5.2 and DeepSeek V4 Pro were previously at 819200 (800K) despite accepting 1M natively; updated to match Qwen3.7 Max and MiMo V2.5 Pro. The proxy now sends up to 1M to all brains via `truncateMessages`.
- **Brain context window policy formalized in CLAUDE.md**: distinguishes `BrainModelEntry.context` (real upstream limit) from `limit.context` in `opencode.json` and docs (client-visible auto-compact target, 800K for all MiMo-senses brains). The 200K gap is mandatory headroom so the proxy can inject MiMo senses image descriptions without racing the upstream's hard cap.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Cortex Sensorial v3 architecture**: 2 text-only brains via OpenCode Go subscription (`proxy/glm-5.2`, `proxy/deepseek-v4-pro`) plus 1 natively multimodal passthrough (`mimo-v2.5`). Single Bearer token for all upstream models.
- **MiMo V2.5 multimodal senses**: dedicated image-description pipeline replaces Gemini 2.5 Flash for the vision flow. Significantly cheaper ($0.14 input / $0.28 output per 1M tokens) and tuned with a Spanish-language technical prompt.
- **OpenCode Go client service**: new `opencodeGoService` supports both `/chat/completions` (OpenAI-format, Bearer auth) and `/messages` (Anthropic-format, `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`) endpoints, with retry, exponential backoff, and SSE buffering.
- **Brain registry**: single source of truth (`brainRegistry.ts`) for brain and passthrough entries, including per-brain `endpoint` (openai|anthropic), `context`, `maxOutput`, `thinking` flag, pricing, and `multimodal` flag. Uses `Object.hasOwn()` for prototype-safe lookups.
- **Shared message transforms**: `prepareMessages` (filter valid roles, normalize content, preserve `tool_calls` / `reasoning_content`) and `truncateMessages` (token-aware trim to fit per-brain context) extracted into `messageTransforms.ts`.
- **Retry with exponential backoff**: 3 attempts with 2s/4s delays on upstream 503/502/429, respecting the `Retry-After` header.
- **SSE streaming hardening**: line-buffer + `safeEnd` guard prevents double-end stream bugs and `data: [DONE]` mishandling.
- **Claude Code compat**: `/v1/messages` route maps `haiku` → `mimo-v2.5` (passthrough), `sonnet` → `proxy/deepseek-v4-pro`, `opus` → `proxy/glm-5.2` (configurable via `CLAUDE_HAIKU_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL`).
- **`vision-mimo` routing strategy**: when a text-only brain receives an image, the image is described by MiMo V2.5 and the description is forwarded to the brain.
- **OpenCode CLI compat**: `/v1/models` lists 2 brain models + 1 passthrough; usable as `provider` in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for OpenCode subscribers.
- **Unit tests**: 131 unit tests covering `opencodeGoService` (retry, SSE buffering, OpenAI/Anthropic translation, tools), `brainRegistry`, `mimoSensesService`, `multimodalProcessor` (passthrough + vision-mimo + Gemini fallback).
- **Docs**: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `MODELS.md`, `src/services/README.md`, `src/middleware/README.md` rewritten to reflect v3 architecture and Claude Code mappings.

### Changed

- **Project renamed**: `deepseek-multimodal-proxy` (v2.0.0) → `cortex-multimodal-proxy` (v3.0.0). Container name, `/health` `service`, scripts, and all documentation reflect the new name.
- **GitHub repo renamed** from `exithial/deepseek-multimodal-proxy` to `exithial/cortex-multimodal-proxy`. Origin URL, badges, clone commands, and CI workflow references all updated.
- **Default context limit raised to 819200** (800K with 200K headroom for MiMo V2.5 image descriptions) for both brains.
- **Max thinking always-on**: every brain request includes `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` for maximum reasoning quality.
- **`/v1/models` is now context-aware**: returns the Claude Code aliases (`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`) when the Anthropic `anthropic-version` header is present, otherwise returns the proxy brains for OpenCode.
- **Anthropic payload translation** happens in `opencodeGoService` instead of being scattered across handlers. OpenAI tools and tool_calls are translated to Anthropic `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks when a brain's `endpoint === "anthropic"`.

### Removed

- **DeepSeek V4 client**: `deepseekService.ts` deleted (replaced by `opencodeGoService` + `messageTransforms`).
- **`vision-direct` strategy**: legacy "Gemini-direct bypass" removed now that `haiku` maps to the mimo-v2.5 passthrough. `vision-direct` test cases removed from integration tests.
- **`deepseek-v4-flash` model**: replaced by `proxy/deepseek-v4-pro`. Tests updated to the surviving brain model.

### Fixed

- **SSE double-end bug**: streaming responses could write `[DONE]` twice on retry/race conditions; `safeEnd` flag ensures single terminal callback.
- **Anthropic auth header**: `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` required (verified empirically against OpenCode Go Anthropic endpoint); Bearer auth caused silent 401s.
- **Prototype pollution risk** in model registry lookups: switched from direct `BRAIN_MODELS[id]` to `Object.hasOwn()` for safe access on untrusted model id input.
- **CI badge and shields.io links** pointing to the old GitHub repository name (post-rename) updated to `exithial/cortex-multimodal-proxy`.

- **Multimodalidad Completa**: Soporte nativo para audio y video usando Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite.
- **Routing Inteligente**: Nuevo sistema de detección (`multimodalDetector.ts`) que clasifica contenido en 8 tipos (incluyendo soporte robusto para Data URIs/Base64).
- **Suite de Pruebas Maestra**: Nuevo script `test/test-master.js` para validación automatizada de todas las trayectorias de routing (Text, Image, Audio, Video, PDF, Base64, Streaming).
- **Procesamiento de Documentos**: Soporte para análisis de documentos (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) y PDFs vía Gemini API.
- **Procesamiento Local de PDF**: Extracción de texto local para PDFs pequeños (<1MB) para velocidad y privacidad.
- **Validación Proactiva**: Peticiones HEAD para validar tamaño de archivos (>50MB) antes de iniciar descargas.

### Fixed

- **Base64 Detection**: Corregido problema de routing donde las imágenes en Base64 se enviaban directamente a DeepSeek en lugar de Gemini.
- **Streaming Consistency**: Mejora en el cierre de streams SSE para asegurar compatibilidad total con el cliente de OpenCode.
- **Tipado TypeScript**: Actualizadas interfaces de `MessageContent` para incluir `input_audio` y otros tipos multimodales.

### Changed

- **Identidad del Proxy**: Renombrado de "Vision Proxy" a "Multimodal Proxy" para reflejar nuevas capacidades.
- **Integración Gemini**: Actualizado `geminiService.ts` para manejar múltiples tipos de contenido más allá de imágenes.
- **Lógica de Routing**: El passthrough a DeepSeek ahora es selectivo (solo texto/código), desviando todo el contenido multimedia a Gemini.
- **Manejo de PDFs**: Implementado sistema híbrido (Local para velocidad/privacidad, Gemini para complejidad/OCR).
- **Validación de Tamaño**: Implementadas requests HEAD previas a la descarga para rechazar archivos > 50MB tempranamente.

### Documentation

- **Guías**: Actualizados `README.md`, `MODELS.md` y `TESTING.md` con la nueva terminología multimodal.
- **Ejemplos**: Añadidos casos de uso para audio, video y documentos complejos.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Endpoint de Health**: Sincronizada la versión reportada en `/health` para que coincida dinámicamente con `package.json`.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Configuración por Entorno**: Ahora los límites de tokens son totalmente configurables vía `.env` (`DEEPSEEK_CONTEXT_WINDOW_CHAT`, `DEEPSEEK_MAX_OUTPUT_CHAT`, etc.).
- **Límites Granulares**: Control independiente de ventana de contexto y salida para modelos Chat y Reasoner.

### Changed

- **Límites de Salida (Propuesta Captura)**: Aumentados para aprovechar al máximo los modelos (Chat: 8k, Reasoner: 64k).
- **Limpieza de Código**: Eliminadas todas las referencias residuales y comentarios legacy de Ollama en `deepseekService.ts` y documentación interna.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- **Límites de Salida (Output)**: Aumentados significativamente para aprovechar al máximo la capacidad de los modelos DeepSeek.
  - `DeepSeek Chat`: De 4k a **8k** tokens.
  - `DeepSeek Reasoner`: De 16k a **64k** tokens.
- **Documentación**: Actualizados `README.md` y `MODELS.md` con los nuevos límites y configuración recomendada para OpenCode.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Removed

- **Soporte Ollama**: Eliminada completamente la integración con Ollama. El proxy ahora es exclusivamente para DeepSeek con visión Gemini.
- **Modelos Locales**: Eliminados, ya no se redirigen peticiones a instancias locales.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Compatibilidad OpenCode**: Corregido problema donde el modelo `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` no funcionaba correctamente en OpenCode, mostrando error "Unable to connect".
- **Streaming Ollama**: Solucionado problema donde OpenCode borraba mensajes después de que Ollama terminaba de responder. Ahora se envía correctamente el chunk final con `finish_reason: 'stop'`.
- **Doble Finalización**: Prevenida llamada duplicada a `onEnd()` en el streaming de Ollama mediante bandera `streamEnded`.

### Changed

- **Simplificación de Modelos Ollama**: Eliminada compatibilidad con `deepseek-coder` de Ollama. Ahora solo `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` está disponible como modelo local.
- **Mapeo de Modelos**: Actualizado para soportar directamente `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` (con dos puntos) para compatibilidad nativa con OpenCode.
- **Endpoint de Modelos**: Reducida lista de modelos expuestos en `/v1/models` para reflejar solo `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` y sus alias.

### Technical

- **Consistencia de Stream**: Implementado ID de stream consistente y timestamp fijo para todos los chunks de una misma respuesta.
- **Formato SSE Mejorado**: Streaming de Ollama ahora envía chunk final con `finish_reason: 'stop'` y `delta: {}` como espera OpenCode.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Integración Ollama**: Soporte para modelos locales de Ollama (qwen2.5:7b-instruct y deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct-q8_0) a través del proxy.
- **Enrutamiento Inteligente**: Sistema que detecta automáticamente si un request debe ir a DeepSeek o Ollama basado en el modelo solicitado.
- **Visión Unificada**: Todos los modelos (DeepSeek y Ollama) ahora se benefician del procesamiento de imágenes con Gemini.
- **Scripts de Automatización**: Sistema completo de scripts bash para instalación, verificación y desinstalación del proxy.
- **Servicio Systemd**: Configuración de inicio automático como servicio del sistema con reinicio automático.
